	abstract = {The mathematical statement for contact problem with unilateral restrictions and friction is done in classical and weak forms. Different variational formulation of unilateral contact problems with friction based on principles of virtual displacements and virtual stresses are considered. Especially boundary variational functionals that are used with boundary integral equations have been established. Nonsmooth optimization algorithms of Udzawa type for solution of unilateral contact problem with friction have been developed. Some theoretical results of existence and uniqueness in elastostatic unilateral contact problem with friction are outlined.},
